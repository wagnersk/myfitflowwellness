1- In our work we encounter a lot of problems. Think about a
problem that you had and how were you able to fix it.

I had problem with a equipament codebar reader , when the equipaments try to read codebar the card-id from people to check presence , Its was failing all time, making a big queue at door. Everyday the sunlight at 16PM blocks the laser from equipament and start making error on reader all time on this hour only. So i just switched the codebar reader with a simple keyboard , this simple thing make everybody can go away from home 20 min earler.


2- What is the most common problem you find at work?
Share with your classmates and discuss the possible
solutions.

3- Have you ever had a problem with a co-worker? What
happened? Talk about it with the other students

In my last project i had a problem because with a backend developer.
He didnt said nothing and just quit the project with a lot tasks to do, 1 month lacking to finish the deadline, so i had to studdy nodejs faster to solve all tasks
